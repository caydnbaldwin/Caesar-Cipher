# Caesar Cipher
A python script implementation of a Caesar Cipher.

## Instructions
Generate a randomized substitution cipher, map the decoded and encoded alphabet together as a key, and save it to a `.csv` file. Encode the text from an input file and write it to a new file. Decode the text from an input file and write it to a new file. Perform a character frequency analysis on the text from an input file and write it to a new file.

## Application
This program explores the mechanics of encoding and decoding while learning about character frequency analysis.

## Download and Run
1) Download and extract the [root directory](https://github.com/caydnbaldwin/Caesar-Cipher/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
2) Build and run `Dockerfile`
3) Configure the tests in the `test_files` subdirectory
4) Run `test_build_cipher.py`, `test_decode.py`, `test_encode.py`, and `test_frequency.py`
5) Run `build_cipher.py`, `decode.py`, `encode.py`, and `frequency.py`
